# TikTok Content Performance Analysis

This project analyzes one year of TikTok creator analytics data to identify key drivers of engagement and audience conversion.

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Feature engineering
- Time-based trend analysis
- Linear regression modeling

## Key Insights
- Engagement varies significantly by posting day.
- Higher view counts modestly increase engagement but do not reliably drive profile clicks.
- Content quality and intent are more important for conversion than reach alone.
